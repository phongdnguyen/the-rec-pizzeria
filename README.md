# Background

This project was unofficially created for a local pizza restaurant. The company originally had a simple static webpage that provided a link to their online POS system. Their online business is handled by this platform, [ToastTab](http://toasttab.com). This POS system ties into their brick and mortar stores. 

The goal of this project is not to replace the existing infratructure, but to enhance and elevate the customer online experience. Currently the company uses multiple platforms to market their restaurant: [Yelp](http://yelp.com/therecpizzeria), [Facebook](http://fb.com/therecpizzeria), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/therecpizzeria), and their website [theREC Pizzeria](http://therecpizzeria.com).

# User Story

1. As a customer that has no idea about the difference between traditional vs. Detroit style pizza, I want to see high quality pictures of the menu so that I know what Detroit style pizza is and what the creatively named pizzas look like. 

2. As a manager I want to be able to easily update my website content, i.e. prices, store hours, promotional offers, etc., so that I can provide the most current information without having to commission my web developer each time to update website content.

3. As a manager I want potential customers that have unique and large orders (corporate events, parties, etc.) able to make inquires as to catering options and pricing so that these potential customers are aware we cater events in addition to our normal restaurant business.

4. As a manager I want to provide my customers with a unified online experience so that my customers are not confused when they are redirected to different platforms to complete different tasks.
